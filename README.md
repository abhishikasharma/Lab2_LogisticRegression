We are implementing Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset. We have created a detailed video on how Logistic Regression works and how to implement it on the Titanic Dataset. Later on we want you guys to try on your own to implement Logistic regression on the Suvdata dataset.

### The main task is what factors made people more interesting in buying SUV??

What is Logistic regression in python? <br> 
It is a technique to analyse a data-set which has a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to predict the outcome in a binary variable, meaning it will have only two outcomes. <br>
Example- <br>
yes or no <br>
1 or 0 <br>
True or False <br>

#### Use Cases

Following are the use cases where we can use logistic regression.

1. Weather Prediction
   Weather predictions are the result of logical regression.
   Here, we analyse the data of the previous weather reports and predict the possible outcome for a specific day.
   But logical regression would only predict categorical data, like if its going to rain or not.

2. Determining Illness is also one of the use cases used in logical regression. 


Dependent variable - target variable <br>
Independent variables -  predictors <br>


Steps for logistic regression:

1. Collecting Data                                                   
2. Analyzing Data                                         
3. Data Wrangling
4. Train and Test                      
5. Accuracy Report
