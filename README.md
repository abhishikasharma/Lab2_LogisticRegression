# Lab2_LogisticRegression

We are implementing Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset. We have created a detailed video on how Logistic reggression works and how to implement it on the Titanic Dataset. Later on we want you guys to try on your own to implement Logistic regression on the Suvdata dataset.

What is Logistic regression in python? 
It is a technique to analyse a data-set which has a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to predict the outcome in a binary variable, meaning it will have only two outcomes. Example- yes or no

Use Cases

Following are the use cases where we can use logistic regression.

Weather Prediction
Weather predictions are the result of logical regression.
Here, we analyse the data of the previous weather reports and predict the possible outcome for a specific day.
But logical regression would only predict categorical data, like if its going to rain or not.

Determining Illness is also one of the use cases used in logical regression. 

Dependent variable - target variable
Independent variables -  predictors
