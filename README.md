# Lab2_LogisticRegression

What is Logistic regression in python? 
It is a technique to analyse a data-set which has a dependent variable and one or more independent variables to predict the outcome in a binary variable, meaning it will have only two outcomes. Example- yes or no

Use Cases

Following are the use cases where we can use logistic regression.

Weather Prediction
Weather predictions are the result of logical regression.
Here, we analyse the data of the previous weather reports and predict the possible outcome for a specific day.
But logical regression would only predict categorical data, like if its going to rain or not.

Determining Illness is also one of the use cases used in logical regression. 

Dependent variable - target variable
Independent variables -  predictors
